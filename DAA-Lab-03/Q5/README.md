# Multiplying Special-Pattern Matrices in O(n²) — Divide & Conquer

Two `n x n` matrices (`n = 2^k`) are given, each with the recursive
block structure

```
        | M1  M2 |
   M =  |        |
        | M2  M1 |
```

where `M1` and `M2` are themselves `(n/2) x (n/2)` matrices with the
**same** recursive pattern, all the way down to `1 x 1` scalars.

Goal: multiply two such matrices in **O(n²)** time — much better than
the `O(n³)` naive bound and even better than Strassen's `O(n^2.807)`,
by exploiting the special structure.

## 2. Key Structural Insight

### 2.1 The product of two special matrices is again special

Let

```
A = | A1  A2 |        B = | B1  B2 |
    | A2  A1 |            | B2  B1 |
```

Multiply as ordinary 2×2 block matrices:

```
AB = | A1B1+A2B2   A1B2+A2B1 |
     | A2B1+A1B2   A2B2+A1B1 |
```

Define `C1 = A1B1 + A2B2` and `C2 = A1B2 + A2B1`. Then:

- top-left     = `C1`
- top-right    = `C2`
- bottom-left  = `A2B1 + A1B2 = C2`  (addition commutes)
- bottom-right = `A2B2 + A1B1 = C1`

So

```
AB = | C1  C2 |
     | C2  C1 |
```

**The product has exactly the same special pattern.** This closure
property is what makes a clean recursive algorithm possible: we never
need to touch a "generic" unpatterned matrix except transiently.

Also note: if `X` and `Y` are both special-pattern matrices, `X + Y`
and `X - Y` are trivially special-pattern too (block-wise sum/difference
of two symmetric-under-swap block matrices retains the symmetry).

### 2.2 Naive recursive count: 4 multiplications (not enough)

Computing `C1 = A1B1+A2B2` and `C2 = A1B2+A2B1` directly needs 4
half-size multiplications: `A1B1, A2B2, A1B2, A2B1`. Recurrence:

```
T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n^2)
```

By the Master theorem (`a=4, b=2, d=2`, `log_b a = 2 = d`):

```
T(n) = O(n^2 log n)      <-- NOT O(n^2). Not good enough.
```

### 2.3 The Karatsuba-style trick: only 3 multiplications

Just like Karatsuba's trick for multiplying two 2-term expressions
with 3 products instead of 4, define:

```
P1 = A1 * B1
P2 = A2 * B2
P3 = (A1 + A2) * (B1 + B2)
```

Expand `P3`:

```
P3 = A1B1 + A1B2 + A2B1 + A2B2 = (A1B1 + A2B2) + (A1B2 + A2B1)
   = C1 + C2
```

So:

```
C1 = P1 + P2
C2 = P3 - C1        (= P3 - P1 - P2)
```

Only **3** recursive multiplications are required:
`P1 = A1*B1`, `P2 = A2*B2`, `P3 = (A1+A2)*(B1+B2)` — and crucially,
`A1+A2` and `B1+B2` are themselves special-pattern matrices of size
`n/2`, so `P3` is a valid recursive call of the *same* algorithm.

## 3. The Algorithm

### 3.1 Pseudocode

```
function SPECIAL-MULTIPLY(A, B, n):
    if n == 1:
        return [ A[0][0] * B[0][0] ]

    half = n / 2
    A1 = top-left  half x half block of A
    A2 = top-right half x half block of A
    B1 = top-left  half x half block of B
    B2 = top-right half x half block of B

    SA = A1 + A2                      # O(half^2), still special-pattern
    SB = B1 + B2                      # O(half^2), still special-pattern

    P1 = SPECIAL-MULTIPLY(A1, B1, half)
    P2 = SPECIAL-MULTIPLY(A2, B2, half)
    P3 = SPECIAL-MULTIPLY(SA, SB, half)

    C1 = P1 + P2                      # O(half^2)
    C2 = P3 - C1                      # O(half^2)

    C = | C1  C2 |                    # O(n^2) to assemble
        | C2  C1 |

    return C
```

Base case `n = 1`: multiplying two scalars, `O(1)`.

### 3.2 Why only the top blocks are needed

Because `M2` already appears in *both* off-diagonal positions and
`M1` in both diagonal positions, the bottom half of the input matrix
carries no new information — `A1` and `A2` (extracted once, from the
top half) fully determine `A`. The algorithm therefore only ever
reads/derives from the top-left and top-right quadrants at each
level.

### 3.3 A nice corollary — information content

Let `f(n)` = number of independent scalar entries needed to fully
specify a special-pattern `n x n` matrix. Since the matrix is
determined by two `(n/2) x (n/2)` special matrices:

```
f(n) = 2 f(n/2),    f(1) = 1     =>     f(n) = n
```

So an `n x n` special matrix really only carries **n** degrees of
freedom (not `n²`) — this is analogous to a circulant matrix being
fully determined by one row. `special_matmul.c` uses this fact: the
program builds a guaranteed-valid input matrix from just `n` numbers
(function `buildSpecialFromSeq`), recursively expanding them into the
full `n x n` array.

---

## 4. Complexity Analysis

### 4.1 Recurrence

Per level of recursion: 3 recursive calls on size `n/2`, plus a
constant number of `O(n^2)`-time matrix additions/subtractions
(computing `SA`, `SB`, `C1`, `C2`) and an `O(n^2)` assembly step:

```
T(n) = 3 T(n/2) + O(n^2),    T(1) = O(1)
```

### 4.2 Solving with the Master Theorem

Master form `T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n^d)` with `a = 3`, `b = 2`, `d = 2`.

Compare `d` to `log_b(a) = log2(3) ≈ 1.585`:

```
d = 2  >  log2(3) ≈ 1.585
```

Since the top level dominates (case 3 of the Master theorem):

```
T(n) = O(n^d) = O(n^2)
```

### 4.3 Verifying by unrolling the recurrence directly

```
T(n) = c*n^2 + 3*T(n/2)
     = c*n^2 + 3[c*(n/2)^2 + 3*T(n/4)]
     = c*n^2 + 3c*(n/2)^2 + 9c*(n/4)^2 + ... + 3^k * c * (n/2^k)^2   (k = log2 n)
     = c*n^2 * sum_{i=0}^{k} (3/4)^i
```

`sum_{i=0}^{∞} (3/4)^i = 1/(1 - 3/4) = 4` (convergent geometric series,
since `3/4 < 1`), so:

```
T(n) <= 4c*n^2 = O(n^2)
```

This confirms the O(n²) bound rigorously — the work strictly
*decreases* geometrically as recursion depth increases (each level
does `3/4` of the previous level's work), so the **top level alone
already accounts for a constant fraction of the total cost**.

### 4.4 Complexity comparison

| Algorithm                              | Time         |
|------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Naive (ignores structure)                 | `O(n^3)`     |
| Strassen (ignores structure, general case)| `O(n^2.807)` |
| **This algorithm (exploits structure)**   | **`O(n^2)`** |

`O(n^2)` is also **optimal up to constant factors**: just *writing
out* the `n x n` output matrix takes `Ω(n^2)` time, so no algorithm
that outputs the full matrix can beat `O(n^2)`.

### 4.5 Space complexity

- Each level allocates `O(n^2)` auxiliary space (blocks, sums, the
  assembled output), and, exactly as with the time recurrence, this
  telescopes to `O(n^2)` total: `S(n) = 3S(n/2) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)`.
- Using the length-`n` generating-sequence representation from
  §3.3, both **input** matrices can be stored in `O(n)` space instead
  of `O(n^2)` — a nice practical optimization not required by the
  problem but implemented in the demo program for convenience.

---

## 5. Correctness

The algorithm's correctness follows directly from the two identities
proved in §2:

1. `AB` retains the special pattern (§2.1) — so the recursive
   "shape" of the problem is preserved at every level, which is a
   prerequisite for the recursion to even type-check.
2. `C1 = P1+P2` and `C2 = P3-P1-P2` correctly reproduce
   `A1B1+A2B2` and `A1B2+A2B1` respectively (§2.3) — verified purely
   by algebraic expansion, independent of `n`.

Combined with a correct base case (`n=1`, scalar multiply), induction
on `k` (where `n = 2^k`) gives full correctness for all `n`.

`Q5.c` also includes a **runtime self-check**: it builds
matrices guaranteed to satisfy the pattern, runs both the D&C
algorithm and a brute-force `O(n^3)` multiply, and prints whether the
two results match — confirmed for `n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...` during
testing.

## 8. Extensions / Notes

- The same 3-multiplication trick is the reason Karatsuba's integer
  multiplication beats grade-school multiplication — this problem is
  structurally the same idea applied to a matrix-valued "coefficient".
- If the block pattern were `[[M1, M2], [M3, M4]]` with *no* relation
  between the blocks (i.e. a general matrix, Strassen's setting),
  closure under multiplication no longer holds trivially and 7
  multiplications are needed, giving `O(n^log2 7) ≈ O(n^2.807)`
  instead of `O(n^2)` — this contrast is exactly why exploiting the
  given matrices' special structure is so much more powerful here.
- The generating-sequence trick (§3.3) generalizes: matrices whose
  recursive block pattern is invariant under a group action (here,
  the group `Z/2` acting by swapping blocks) are fully determined by
  one representative per group orbit — the same underlying idea used
  for circulant matrices and the Fast Fourier Transform.
